# SIH 2020 Project (failed)
## STUDENT GRIEVANCE SYSTEM

* [Het Patel](https://github.com/phoenixcreation) took the meaning of word 'grievance' in a wrong way
So this system is not logically correct.
* But it is completely working example of auth system and CRUD system in java with sqlite3 database connection.

### This project features:
- Sqlite3 database connection with java.
- Auth system(login and signup) in java with sqlite3 for different categories. 
- CRUD operations in java with sqlite3.
- UI construction using Jframe in java.
- Can be convertered into fully functional working desktop application.

### how to run?
To be honest I don't know how to run this project without configuring eclipse IDE for jframe development. 
So clone the repo. Open in eclipse IDE and pray the God that it runs.
- Main entry point file to be run is [login.java](/src/login.java)
- make sure you have sqlite database null for better results.


### Some things to be considered before judging this project.
- This project was made just for learning purposes.
- It is one of the first project of developers.
- It was completely headerless project. Even the developers didn't knew what they were doing.
- At the time of development, UI was not anything for developers so the UI system don't even exists in this project. 
- It is not well done project in terms of creating proper mannered project.
